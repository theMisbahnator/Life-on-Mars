Using certain commands, the bot can provide photos from the surface of Mars taken 
from active Rovers using the [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/). You can chose between latest photos or a 
specified date. Additionaly, you can access weather patterns (currently in the works)

Furthermore, you can read up on the latest news about mars with the 
provided relevent news scrapped of the interntet using a web scraper.

Enjoy! - Misbah Imtiaz
