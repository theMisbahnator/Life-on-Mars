Using certain commands, the bot can provide photos from the surface of Mars taken 
from active Rovers using the [NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/). You can choose between latest photos or a 
specified date. Additionally, you can access weather patterns (currently in the works)

Furthermore, you can read up on the latest news about mars with the 
provided relevant news scrapped on the internet using a web scraper.

Enjoy! - Misbah Imtiaz

Here are the commands below:
Note: the part of commands attached to the $ (ex. $[img] and $[imgCount]) are CASE SENSITIVE.
